## Classes:
The Classes are given as integers from `1` to `MaxClasses`, where `MaxClasses` is the maximum number of classes in the data. `0` is reserved for instances that can't be in any Class.

## Data Generation:

## Data Structure :
Each instance of the problems should be stroed in a csv file with the following format:
| id  |  mark_1  |  mark_2  |      class   |
|---- |----|----|----|
|  0  |  12  |  16  |     1     |
|  1  |  18  |  2  |     0    |
|  2  |  18  |  10  |     1    |
