# This is a project for decision systems

Please feel free to read the file `MR-Sort-NCS.pdf` to understand the case.



# Data Structure :
Each instance of the problems should be stroed in a csv file with the following format:
| id  |  note_1  |  note_2  |      classe   |
|---- |----|----|----|
|  0  |  12  |  16  |     1     |
|  1  |  18  |  2  |     0    |
|  2  |  18  |  10  |     1    |



w_1 w_2 w_3 


lambda
w_1 note_1
w_2 note_2
w_3 note_3
w_4 note_4

b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4

sum(weights) = 1
sum(weights, tq w_i>=b_i) >= lambda
sum(weights, tq w_i>=b_i) >= lambda
